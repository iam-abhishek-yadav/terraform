## Initialize Terraform**

In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing your Terraform configuration files and execute:

```
terraform init
```

This command initializes the Terraform working directory, downloading any required provider plugins.

## Apply the Configuration

Execute the following command to instantiate the AWS resources specified in your Terraform configuration:

```
terraform apply
```

Terraform will present a plan detailing the modifications it intends to make. Carefully review the plan and respond with "yes" when prompted to apply the changes.

## Verify Resources

Upon completion of the Terraform provisioning process, validate the creation of resources either through the AWS Management Console or by utilizing AWS CLI commands.

## Destroy Resources

To delete the resources generated by Terraform, utilize the following command:

```
terraform destroy
```

### Exercise caution when executing terraform destroy as it will remove resources as outlined in your Terraform configuration.
